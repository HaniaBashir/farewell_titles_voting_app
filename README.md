👉 [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

Steps:

1. Click **New Project**
2. Import your GitHub repo
3. Add the same environment variables from your `.env`

## ⚙️ Admin setup flow

Once deployed, go to:

```text
/admin

---

## 🏷️ Step 1 — Add Titles

* Go to **Titles**
* Add your farewell titles
* Choose the type:

  * `single` → one person
  * `duo` → two people

---

## 👩‍🎓 Step 2 — Add Students

You have 2 options:

### Option A — Manual

* Enter roll number and name
* Click **Add student**

### Option B — CSV Upload (recommended)

Upload a CSV like this:

```csv
Roll Number,Student Name
22i-2506,Hania Bashir
22i-2629,Abdul Faheem
```

The CSV parser is designed to be flexible with column names.

---

## 📤 Step 3 — Export CSV

Go to:

**Export CSV**

This generates a downloadable CSV with:

* `roll_number`
* `student_name`
* `email`
* `password`
* `sent`

This is the file you’ll use in Google Sheets to email credentials to your class.

---

## 📧 Send passwords automatically using Google Sheets

### Step 1 — Open Google Sheets

👉 [https://sheets.google.com](https://sheets.google.com)

Import your exported CSV file.

### Step 2 — Open Apps Script

From the top menu:

**Extensions → Apps Script**

```javascript
function sendVotingEmails() {
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
  const data = sheet.getDataRange().getValues();
  const subject = "Your Farewell Voting Access";

  for (let i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {
    const rollNumber = data[i][0];
    const studentName = data[i][1];
    const email = data[i][2];
    const password = data[i][3];
    const sentStatus = data[i][4];

    if (!email || !password) continue;
    if (sentStatus === "YES") continue;

    const body = `Hi ${studentName},

You have been given access to the farewell voting website.

Your details are:

Roll Number: ${rollNumber}
Password: ${password}

Voting Link:
PASTE_YOUR_WEBSITE_LINK_HERE

Important:
- You can vote only once
- Do not share your password
- No self voting allowed

Good luck ✨`;

    GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
    sheet.getRange(i + 1, 5).setValue("YES");
  }
}
```

### Step 4 — Replace the voting link

Replace:

```text
PASTE_YOUR_WEBSITE_LINK_HERE
```

with your deployed Vercel URL, for example:

```text
https://YOUR_VERCEL_LINK.vercel.app
```

### Step 5 — Run it

1. Click **Run**
